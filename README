1. WHAT IS BAZINGA?

bazinga is a small and (maybe) simple commandline interface which lets you publish articles
on a blog without the need of PHP/MySQL or CGI. It produces plain HTML-files in a clean and
reasonable directory structure and links them together. This seems quite static at a first 
look, but the advantages of this model are clear: you don't need a webhoster which allows
previously mentioned features. The pages produced should be 100 % display-able by any common
HTTP server.


1.1. WHY IS IT BETTER THAN XYZ?

To be honest, it clearly isn't better than any other blog software and maybe cannot even 
compete with them in flexibility and feature-richness, but the clear advantages are:

    - completely independent from fancy features (eq. PHP)
    - easy to maintain
    - easy to make backups (just backup the files and you're fine)
    - commandline interface ('bzg') (that's where git and nanoblogger inspired me)

Of course, if you aren't used to work with terminals or generally with text editors
it might be confusing, but if you are a person like me (and I guess you are, otherwise:
why are you reading this crap anyway?) and you like working on terminals, it might be
just the piece of software you always wanted.


1.2. NAME

I chose the name bazinga because I'm a huge fan of the TV series 'Big Bang Theory', where
one of the main actors (Sheldon Cooper) uses the phrase "Bazinga!" to tell others that he
made a joke. Clearly, bazinga is too a little bit of a joke ;).
