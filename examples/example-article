START_ARTICLE
This is my first article published with bazinga. It will show you some features now:

* This makes a list point
* and this too
* unsorted lists are easy...

*bold text* is as easy to write as _underlined text_. /italic text/ too, of course.

If you want to insert a code snipped, bazinga has a special feature for that:

CODE_START
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;

print "hello world\n .... BAZINGA!\n";
CODE_END

END_ARTICLE
