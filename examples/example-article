START_TEXT
This is my first article published with bazinga. It will show you some features now:

[b]bold text[/b] is as easy to write as [u]underlined text[/u]. [i]italic text[/i] too, of course.

If you want to insert a code snipped, bazinga has a special feature for that:

CODE_START
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;

print "hello world\n .... BAZINGA!\n";
CODE_END

CODE_START
#!/bin/bash

echo "hello world\n .... BAZINGA!";
CODE_END

text

END_TEXT
